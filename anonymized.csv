"dop had a scheduled phone call with david tavlin, chief program director at suos to discuss yp's case. david confirmed much of yp's report. he also confirmed that yp was sent a ""perform or quit"" notice on october 28, 2022 which he never opened. property management has not made movement towards eviction, a process that will take 2+ months. david advised for dop to engage yp in reconsidering his willingness to work with wendy or her supervisor francisco from dhs/iccms. according to david, yp did file a grievance,but was then unresponsive to the patient's right department. david agreed to look into the matter more fully and get back to dop with proposed next steps for coordination and advocacy. later in the day, yp called dop. dop sent this email to david that serves as a summary of phone call/intervention/plan for next steps: hi, michael just called me. he had left a message a few days ago saying that he had good news to share and that he would reach back out. so, he has been doing some maintenance work for a local church in hollywood. i'm not actually sure of the details, but he has talked about it for several years. i think it's the church he had received food from when he was out here on the streets. his mentor is mosha and michael shared that he finally decided to share with mosha everything about his current circumstances. he confided that he is behind on rent and scared that he might be evicted; he confided that his apartment is almost unlivable and that he doesn't feel like he has support. he felt really supported by mosha who wanted to come alongside michael and make the repairs for him and help him talk to property management. michael said, ""i know that step up doesn't want me around. i can't force anyone to love me, but this is my home and i deserve it. i want to stay."" i acknowledged the risk taking in being vulnerable and opening up to someone about the truth of our lives. it created an opening to discuss meeting with franscisco. i reflected that while it's so meaningful to have mosha's support, it's important that he doesn't do any repairs that aren't approved by the property manager. michael said that he is willing to meet with both wendy and francisco if that's what it takes. he said, ""what history tells me is that they don't really care about my life, but i want to put everything behind us and focus on making this better for everyone."" i shared that my understanding was that to be ongoingly successful at daniel's village,it was important that he agree to receive services from wendy/francisco. he agreed. i said that i spoke to someone at su today, but didn't use your name and he didn't ask. he was very focused on just doing what is needed to get back on track. we left it at this. he is checking with mosha about his availability to come for a meeting next week. he would also like me to attend and i said that i could coordinate it with francisco, if helpful. michael agreed. it felt positive to me. thoughts?

"hcm mf met with yp briefly to check in about his interest in another interim housing referral as well as begin completing of the spdat. yp was dressed appropriately for the weather but his clothes appeared to be soiled. yp consented to completing the spdat with hcm mf but was observed to be falling asleep. hcm mf stepped away to allow yp to rest after having been on the streets over the weekend and explained that they can revisit the spdat another day. hcm mf sent the following email to yp's fsp clinician steve cordova and suos program manager isabel kindberg after checking in with yp: megan friend <mfriend@myfriendsplace.org> mon, mar 20, 10:35 am (23 hours ago) to steve, ikindberg hi steve, i just wanted to reach out again about jessie chism. he self-discharged from abh riverside on friday, 3/17, and shared that he's been staying in the downtown area since then. i'm going to submit another interim housing referral today but i know that there's a hold for at least a week on interim housing sites in our catchment zone. given that, are there any referrals you're able to do for housing on your end? please let me know. also, i've offered jessie the agency phone to call you with so i will support that when he's able. if you want to meet with him at mfp any time, please let me know and i can help facilitate. thanks! megan hcm mf and pm isabel kindberg exchanged the following emails: isabel kindberg mar 20, 2023, 10:40 am (23 hours ago) to me, steve good morning megan, i am steve's supervisor, steve is out sick today. we can submit an interim housing referral through dmh for him. these options tend to be not the best, however, and we rarely see folks staying in them long term. one question i have is if jessie left abh for a particular reason? is it that he doesn't want to be at that specific shelter any longer? i ask because often they have allowed him to re-enter the shelter after leaving for a couple of days so i am wondering if he's tried that or would be open to trying? megan friend <mfriend@myfriendsplace.org> mar 20, 2023, 10:44 am (22 hours ago) to isabel, steve hi isabel, thanks for the info! from what his cm shared at riverside, he got into an argument with another resident and requested to self-discharge. i asked about flexibility for him to return and unfortunately because he signed discharge paperwork they had to exit him from the program. his cm said that we'd have to submit another interim housing referral in order for him to come back (which i'll do today). isabel kindberg attachments mon, mar 20, 10:50 am (22 hours ago) to me, steve ah ok, i see. i can submit an ihp referral for him as well as a backup option. i will just need him to sign this roi which dmh requires with the referral. would it be possible for you have him sign this and scan it back to me? i also wonder if this might be a good time to discuss the potential of going to treatment since housing options are so limited. i know he's not been open to this when it's been brought up the last few times but wondering if anything's changed? or maybe you've already discussed this with him? megan friend <mfriend@myfriendsplace.org> mon, mar 20, 11:10 am (22 hours ago) to isabel, steve yes! i can get that signed for you and i'll send it back asap. to be honest, i don't know jessie super well and our cm relationship hasn't been extensive at this point beyond coordination and helping him maintain communication/connection to partner providers. he did ask if he could return to riverside. i'll email jeanette and can copy you both on it but i think that even if he was welcomed back i'd have to submit the referral for that catchment zone and then he'd have to wait for another bed to open. can you talk to me more about the conversations that have been had with him re treatment? thanks, megan. i'm sorry today got a bit busy and i wasn't able to respond earlier. once steve is back he may be able to support with getting jessie back into riverside as he's built a strong relationship with some of the staff there-we can consult with him about it tomorrow. regarding treatment-- jessie last went to treatment in 2021 and works with a substance counselor at step up named fuji. fuji's number is 323-394-2370. feel free to reach out to him with jessie or provide jessie with his number if he doesn't have it anymore, even just as a backup staff when steve is unavailable. for some context, jessie's use has increased a great deal in the last couple of years and he definitely struggles to have insight around how the use is impacting him when he's in the midst of it and not clear headed. in my experience with him, he's usually more likely to agree to treatment when an external force is pushing him in that direction-like not having shelter or some kind of legal mandate etc. since you're just getting to know him i get that it may feel hard to have this conversation without rapport firmly established. i am hoping once steve is back he can bring it up to jessie. he has discussed it a few times and jessie's not been open to returning but worth a shot, i think. could you reach out again when he's there next and we can go from there?

i am writing to inquire about re-admission for this young person, william (ln manually removed 6/11/25) (dob: dob removed), age 20, hmis # 8d5f0b448) to your eesp program. since we last spoke on thursday, sept 22nd, my colleague michael collins and i have continued to check in with william, address the behavior identified in the initial bulletin on hmis--which has since been removed--discuss past successes and shortcomings in housing, and explore what would be different in new housing opportunities moving forward (in terms of his engagement and behavior). we believe that the behavior identified in the initial bulletin was a manifestation of trauma, and have seen william's willingness to discuss and address it. william continues to express a desire to lean into his mental health care and speak with a therapist if provided. william has also stated that his time in your eesp program was productive. i reviewed the notes entered by dmh staff at twi (roberto arias and takeo tucker) and have not found any concerning behaviors to be indicated. in fact, he seemed to be pretty engaged, and had a successful exit due to a thp match! lastly, i noticed that he was still accepted into the eesp program at twi after his stay at jovenes, which is where the incident occured. because of this, and his positive engagement at your eesp site, i am wondering if he can be reconsidered for entry. thank you! sincerely, marisa and mike","placeholder - hcm mj and <PERSON> continued to consult with adop <PERSON> re-shared her contact information to the gatekeeper for a phone call/follow up - engaged in phone tag, then sent the following email for advocacy on existing thread 'male bed inquiry (wh)' below... hello ????
