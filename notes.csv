Notes
"HCM JM observed SHC VP and SHC PS crouching down with YP and attempting to engage him in conversation but he appeared in a lethargic mood. HCM JM spoke in a loud tone and introduced herself to the conversation. YP opened his eyes, nodded, and began stating that he was having issues with his Michael's Village apartment. YP reported that he was feeling unsafe staying there because others who he was trying to support were taking over his unit. YP reported that he felt unsafe due to street affiliations. YP reported that he could not be the one to tell them to leave despite SUOS Judy Tate reminding him that he needs to be the one to call the police for assistance. YP asked if MFP could be the ones to visit MV and tell the group of people to leave. YP shared that the people who were staying there had brought bed bugs and thrown out his mattress. HCM JM reinforced the need to speak with his onsite managers about his concerns and shared MFP's capacity in support. HCM JM offered to call JT with him to share his interest in having the people leave and verbalize an understanding of the guidelines moving forward. YP made vague threats about how he would handle this situation if his providers don't step in. HCM JM assessed for intent and means. YP committed to safety and denied having any plan. YP began to fall asleep and doze off. HCM JM spoke in a louder tone and YP responded and said that he was tired since he had not been sleeping in his unit. YP shared annoyance at HCM JM assuming why he was tired. HCM JM expressed care and concern for his safety. YP became animated and asked if there was any way that SUOS and MFP could be the ones to remove these people because he is concerned for his safety if he is the one to remove them. HCM JM reinforced the capacity MFP had to intervene, shared that she would check in with SUOS JT to learn about their plan, and stated how he has to be involved because it is a unit under his name. HCM JM shared that she would reach out to SOUS to share his safety concerns and learn about what their plan is. YP began to read the note that SHC PS had provided about her departing. YP stood up suddenly and expressed deep frustrations with the situation and stated that HCM JM, MFP, and SUOS were not reacting appropriately. HCM JM encouraged him to visit the following day. YP gathered his belongings and left slamming the front gate.

 ""Hey Judy and Chantel,
 

 I wanted to get this to you before the end of the day. I spoke with Cory today about his apartment and the people that are ""squatting"" in it now. He shared some significant safety concerns about them. He felt as if more action needed to take place because he is worried that he will continued to be harassed/physically assaulted if they remain. I redirected him to the property management and to Step Up. However, he's concerned that if the people know he was the one to ask them to leave, his safety is compromised because of their street affiliations. Any way that there can be an intervention that asks them to leave without Cory being the named reason why they need to leave? I know this is a little sticky but would love to hear your thoughts. 
 

 He left MFP today pretty upset that we weren't willing to be the mail interventionists on site. I encouraged him to return on Monday. Please let me know how I can support in this. 
 

 Judy, I tried calling you and left you a voicemail. I'll be available until 4:30 today if you'd like to connect by phone. 
 

 All best,
 Jesenya""
 

 HCM JM will follow up with providers and YP the next time he visits. HCM JM will continue to monitor potential substance use impacts, and safety concerns and consult with ADOP EK about how to support his housing retention."
"DOP had a scheduled phone call with David Tavlin, Chief Program Director at SUOS to discuss YP's case. David confirmed much of YP's report. He also confirmed that YP was sent a ""perform or quit"" notice on October 28, 2022 which he never opened. Property management has not made movement towards eviction, a process that will take 2+ months. David advised for DOP to engage YP in reconsidering his willingness to work with Wendy or her supervisor Francisco from DHS/ICCMS. According to David, YP did file a grievance,but was then unresponsive to the Patient's Right department. David agreed to look into the matter more fully and get back to DOP with proposed next steps for coordination and advocacy. Later in the day, YP called DOP. DOP sent this email to David that serves as a summary of phone call/intervention/plan for next steps:
 

 Hi,
 Michael just called me. He had left a message a few days ago saying that he had good news to share and that he would reach back out.  
 

 So, he has been doing some maintenance work for a local church in Hollywood. I'm not actually sure of the details, but he has talked about it for several years. I think it's the church he had received food from when he was out here on the streets.
 

 His mentor is Mosha and Michael shared that he finally decided to share with Mosha everything about his current circumstances. He confided that he is behind on rent and scared that he might be evicted; he confided that his apartment is almost unlivable and that he doesn't feel like he has support. He felt really supported by Mosha who wanted to come alongside Michael and make the repairs for him and help him talk to property management. Michael said, ""I know that Step Up doesn't want me around. I can't force anyone to love me, but this is my home and I deserve it. I want to stay.""
 

 I acknowledged the risk taking in being vulnerable and opening up to someone about the truth of our lives. It created an opening to discuss meeting with Franscisco. I reflected that while it's so meaningful to have Mosha's support, it's important that he doesn't do any repairs that aren't approved by the property manager. Michael said that he is willing to meet with both Wendy and Francisco if that's what it takes. He said, ""What history tells me is that they don't really care about my life, but I want to put everything behind us and focus on making this better for everyone.""
 

 I shared that my understanding was that to be ongoingly successful at Daniel's Village,it was important that he agree to receive services from Wendy/Francisco. He agreed. I said that I spoke to someone at SU today, but didn't use your name and he didn't ask. He was very focused on just doing what is needed to get back on track.
 

 We left it at this. He is checking with Mosha about his availability to come for a meeting next week. He would also like me to attend and I said that I could coordinate it with Francisco, if helpful. Michael agreed.  
 

 It felt positive to me. Thoughts?
 

 Thanks again,"
"HCM JM received a call from YP around 8:15 AM regarding the appointment to pick up her dog, Camilla (see CM note on 02/07/23). YP sounded in a rushed/energetic tone. YP stated that she was confirming she would come to MFP in a few hours to retrieve her dog. YP stated that she wanted to ensure she was there before closing and would be ordering a Lyft from Orange County. HCM JM invited her to come in for services and to obtain her dog before 1 PM.
 

 HCM JM was alerted around 10:15 AM that YP was at the 76 gas station down the street on Hollywood Blvd in a Lyft ready to retrieve her dog. HCM JM met YP at the gas station with Camilla and her box of outfits. YP emerged from a Lyft in a positive mood, walking briskly, in good hygiene, and speaking in a calm tone. Camilla was observed squealing, wagging her tail furiously, and crying when she saw YP. YP and Camilla had a happy moment of hugging and excitement. HCM JM attempted to have a conversation with her about ever needing animal companion support to return to MFP but YP stated repeatedly that she was happy to have her dog back and did not need additional care. YP stated that she had given YP the dog to watch because ""he was going through a hard time."" YP thanked HCM JM and turned around to walk away briskly and got in a Lyft. HCM JM will continue to offer animal companion support should the need arise."

"YP stopped by the gate about 45 minutes after services and requested food, drink and clothing items. SHC HS provided YP with drinks, a sweatshirt, a blanket and another snack bag. HCM MF came down to the gate to say hello and check in about how YP is doing/where she is staying. YP reported that she is doing ""okay."" HCM MF asked if YP was staying at her apartment and YP reported that she ""moved out because it (the apartment) didn't feel safe."" HCM MF asked for clarification and more details and YP said that she did not like that when she was last staying at her apartment they ""sent her to the hospital."" YP reported that she feels safer on the streets than at her apartment so that is where she is staying for now. HCM MF asked if YP would come by for services tomorrow (Friday, 11/4/2022) and YP confirmed she would. HCM MF texted YP's FSP therapist letting her know that YP stopped by and that HCM MF would keep therapist informed if YP comes tomorrow. HCM MF will continue to communicate with partner providers to share relevant information with the goal of supporting long-term housing and mental health plans. -MF
 

 Update - HCM MF spoke with YP's FSP therapist Martina N. on the phone in regards to the risk that YP may get closed out of services if she is not linked to adult FSP team. Martina confirmed that she is working with adult FSP team to meet with YP and that she (Martina) does not feel comfortable dropping YP down without proper linkage. FSP therapist requested that HCM MF continue contacting her when YP visits MFP so that FSP therapist can potentially visit YP with adult FSP team to connect. FSP therapist discussed YP owing backpaid rent and needing to connect YP with payee services for her SSI so that her rent can be paid and basic needs can be met. FSP therapist requested HCM MF assistance with this and HCM MF said she would speak with ADOP EK about this. HCM MF consulted with ADOP EK re HCM MF setting up payee services and ADOP EK explained that MFP does not have the professional relationship with payee services that FSP and DMH have. HCM MF emailed FSP therapist the following:

 Hi Martina,
 

 Thanks again for chatting with me and explaining your thoughts/plan about Denise! I spoke with Erin K. about payee services, etc. and she said that MFP doesn't have the professional relationships with payee services and that in the past we've typically gone through FSP or DMH to help with that. Do you know of any DMH services that can assist with setting up payee info for Denise?
 

 HCM MF will continue conversation with FSP therapist in order to faciliate partnership and linkage to YP's adult FSP team. -MF"
"HCM MF received the following email from YP's PATH CM Shecaniah Alexander regarding a subpoena that YP received:

 Hi team,
 

 I know its late, but I wanted to update you all regarding Denise' appt on Monday at 8:30. 
 

 Detectives came by this week and spoke with her regarding her ex-boyfriend. 
 

 I will be accompanying her to her subpoena @ 210 W Temple Street 17th floor, Los Angeles CA 90012 Office of the District attorney; DDA Elizabeth D French.
 To my knowledge she will only be speaking to the person's character not to any specific crimes he's committed.
 

 Is it possible to get her excused from this?
 Thanks,
 

 HCM MF asked exploratory questions in subsequent emails and learned that YP has been subpoenaed to appear in court to provide character testimony about her ex-boyfriend (the man that was with YP a few months prior outside of MFP). YP's PATH CM and FSP team members expressed concern over YP's ability to provide testimony and PATH CM SA asked whether YP could be excused from this duty. HCM MF consulted with HCM JM who shared that if someone discloses an inability to appear in court due to mental illness it could take away that person's privilege to their mental health records. HCM MF shared this with YP's PATH CM and FSP team. YP's PATH CM SA shared confusion/question over what protected information she could share regarding YP's mental health/diagnosis. HCM MF was already out for the day and did not see that email until 5/8/23. Please see CM note for response. -MF"
"HCM KM consulted with Fidelis Nwaki, FSP RN while Martina Njoku, FSP Therapist was out on maternity leave to discuss updates for YP. HCM KM provided details of YP's recent presentation in space (please see note under crisis tab dated 8/14/22). FN shared that YP has not been engaged with team and has not taken Ambilify injection in 4 months. FN stated one reason that YP is not taking medication is due to partner whom he described as violent and that he was encouraging YP to not take medication. FN shared that injection will need to be approved by supervisor being YP is in middle of transition to adult FSP. ADOP EK was able to consult with supervisor to confirm information was accurate.

 Hi Steve and Isabel,
 

 I wanted to reach out and check in to get your thoughts on the new Step Up on 3rd building as an option for Jessie. Isabel, I know you're working on the other referral with Brilliant Corners so if you feel like that's a more appropriate referral/opportunity just let me know. 
 

 We've had a few folks be connected to Step Up on 3rd and Chantel Peoples shared with another case manager that there are several spots to be filled. I have a client that's being connected to a unit and will be connected to ICMS. 
 

 Not sure if this is an option to consider but wanted to put it on your radar. I think the only thing that would need to happen ASAP is Jessie would need to get his ID. Do you know if his current ID is expired? The other option we may be able to try is mailing in for a replacement ID but I'm not sure if we can do that if his ID is expired. I'll keep you posted.
 

 Let me know your thoughts!

 Hello Megan,
 

 I believe he was granted the Housing for Mental Health Program and we definitely need his ID, SSC, and proof of income ASAP. The DMH staff that oversee it want weekly updates when a clt is receiving this support. 
 

 We have discussed the possibility of trying to link him to Michael's Village. Since it is so time sensitive, they will withdraw it if there is no progress. So we are hoping to try to match him as fast as possible. Thank you for letting me know he was there on Monday, unfortunately I wasn't available to meet with him. If he comes in again let him know it is important for him to contact me. I believe there is an application he has to complete with some of our housing staff. 
 

 Isabel, does he need to have his documents already in hand to complete it?
 

 I believe Kayla had mentioned possibly having a conversation with him about his age and trying to express that he needs to meet with SUOS consistently if he wants to continue accessing MFP services. I wonder if that would encourage him to meet with us or decrease his contact with both MFP and SUOS. 
 

 I'm not sure if his ID is expired. I believe he will need his physical ID to order a replacement SSC. I just hope SSA doesn't say he has ordered to many replacements and delays the process, which I have seen a couple times in the past.

 Hi Steve,
 

 Thanks for this info. I know we have copies of Jessie's SSC onsite at MFP and I've also uploaded one to Clarity but yes, having a physical copy will be important. I also hope he hasn't requested too many replacements. Am I able to complete a proof of income form with Jessie if/when he visits next? Re his ID, we will continue to encourage him to go on our DMV trips however he has signed up and then won't stay onsite long enough to participate in the trip. 
 

 Jessie's visits are definitely hit or miss and often he comes in but doesn't stay long making it hard for even me to catch him. Is it possible, if/when he does visit next, for us to transport him to a SU office to complete the application(s) you mentioned or will he need to have a specific appointment? We could try the on the spot transport if staff/vehicles allow for it or problem solve to Lyft him there while we follow in a car. 
 

 Yes, I remember us talking about having a transition conversation of sorts in an effort to encourage Jessie to stay involved. I haven't had that convo with Jessie and like you said worry a bit about having that conversation if it meant that as a result he decides to just steer clear of us altogether. Of course I realize that's his decision to make but with the housing opportunities on the table, I want to maintain connection for updates and other things that need to be done. 
 

 Thanks!
 Megan

 Hi Steve,
 

 I just wanted to reach out again about Jessie Chism. He self-discharged from ABH Riverside on Friday, 3/17, and shared that he's been staying in the downtown area since then. I'm going to submit another interim housing referral today but I know that there's a hold for at least a week on interim housing sites in our catchment zone. Given that, are there any referrals you're able to do for housing on your end? 
 

 Please let me know. Also, I've offered Jessie the agency phone to call you with so I will support that when he's able. If you want to meet with him at MFP any time, please let me know and I can help facilitate. 
 

 Thanks!

 Good Morning Megan,
 

 I am Steve's supervisor, Steve is out sick today. We can submit an Interim Housing Referral through DMH for him. These options tend to be not the best, however, and we rarely see folks staying in them long term. 
 

 One question I have is if Jessie left ABH for a particular reason? Is it that he doesn't want to be at that specific shelter any longer? I ask because often they have allowed him to re-enter the shelter after leaving for a couple of days so I am wondering if he's tried that or would be open to trying?

 Hi Isabel,
 

 Thanks for the info! From what his CM shared at Riverside, he got into an argument with another resident and requested to self-discharge. I asked about flexibility for him to return and unfortunately because he signed discharge paperwork they had to exit him from the program. His CM said that we'd have to submit another interim housing referral in order for him to come back (which I'll do today).

 Ah ok, I see. I can submit an IHP referral for him as well as a backup option. I will just need him to sign this ROI which DMH requires with the referral. Would it be possible for you have him sign this and scan it back to me?
 

 I also wonder if this might be a good time to discuss the potential of going to treatment since housing options are so limited. I know he's not been open to this when it's been brought up the last few times but wondering if anything's changed? Or maybe you've already discussed this with him? 
 

 Megan Friend <mfriend@myfriendsplace.org>
 Mon, Mar 20, 11:10 AM (22 hours ago)

 Yes! I can get that signed for you and I'll send it back ASAP. 
 

 To be honest, I don't know Jessie super well and our CM relationship hasn't been extensive at this point beyond coordination and helping him maintain communication/connection to partner providers. He did ask if he could return to Riverside. I'll email Jeanette and can copy you both on it but I think that even if he was welcomed back I'd have to submit the referral for that catchment zone and then he'd have to wait for another bed to open. Can you talk to me more about the conversations that have been had with him re treatment? 
 

 Thanks, Megan.
 

 I'm sorry today got a bit busy and I wasn't able to respond earlier. Once Steve is back he may be able to support with getting Jessie back into Riverside as he's built a strong relationship with some of the staff there-we can consult with him about it tomorrow.
 

 Regarding treatment-- Jessie last went to treatment in 2021 and works with a Substance Counselor at Step Up named Fuji. Fuji's number is 323-394-2370. Feel free to reach out to him with Jessie or provide Jessie with his number if he doesn't have it anymore, even just as a backup staff when Steve is unavailable.
 

 For some context, Jessie's use has increased a great deal in the last couple of years and he definitely struggles to have insight around how the use is impacting him when he's in the midst of it and not clear headed. In my experience with him, he's usually more likely to agree to treatment when an external force is pushing him in that direction-like not having shelter or some kind of legal mandate etc. 
 

 Since you're just getting to know him I get that it may feel hard to have this conversation without rapport firmly established. I am hoping once Steve is back he can bring it up to Jessie. He has discussed it a few times and Jessie's not been open to returning but worth a shot, I think. Could you reach out again when he's there next and we can go from there? 
 

 Thanks so much!

 ""Hello and Good Morning
 

 Sorry for those that called me yesterday and my late response, but I was out sick at the last minute. Per discussion as for relocation, DMH has a process for relocation, and Brandon's situation would not qualify him for it. As for change of housing options, that has to come from the service provider directly reaching out to DHS/DMH and even then, there's other factors that come into play, in which I wouldn't know but from the information I gathered. Per our conversation Brandon is to only stay at the temporary unit until all repairs are made to return to his assigned unit. 
 

 As for repairs, Danny or the team, was Brandon cooperating and vacated the unit yesterday and today for repairs can be done? Or are things delayed due to recent rains?
 

 Thank you,

 The property management company confirmed that the repairs would be done that day. PM also confirmed that keys for the Magnolia unit would need to be returned upon his arrival at the Colombia Street unit. HCM JM and SUOS Will K, LaVada T, and JC P conferenced throughout the morning to coordinate supporting YP's move and key exchange. Although SUOS LT shared that his team should not be involved with the move for YP nor assisting with a warm hand-off, HCM JM advocated for a service provider to be there due to their hx of negative interactions. HCM JM utilized a strength-based perspective to underscore the importance for a warm handoff and skill-building before YP could engage on his own with his PM. SUOS eventually agreed to assist. However, SUOS nor MFP were able to provide transportation that day and JC P SUOS asked for an extension of one day for SUOS to be able to support the move and warm handoff. PM was amendable and open to extending his stay at Magnolia Street. HCM JM did not have direct contact with YP since his phone was disconnected but SOUS agreed to visit him the following day early to relay the message and assist with packing his belongings/transportation. HCM JM will continue to provide ancillary support for YP's housing retention goals."

 Hi everybody,
 

 I just wanted to provide an update regarding Dontae Argus (Participant 9C0B43F66).
 

 Unfortunately Dontae has not been the drop in center at My Friend's Place since 09/06/22, and he does not have a working phone at this time, so I have been unable to notify him of this match.
 

 I know you were holding the slot until Friday (10/14) last week, so I apologize for sending this a day late!
 

 I just want to confirm that Dontae is unavailable for this match. However, I would like it to be noted that Dontae did not decline the match. I'm hoping to reach back out to Telma regarding a PSH opportunity when he resurfaces (though I understand he may not be re-matched to this same resource/site depending on availability, etc.)
 

 Thank you!

 Hi Telma,
 

 Just wanted to reach out and put a young person (23 year old male) on your radar for PSH: Dontae (LN REMOVED MANUALLY 6/11/25) (DOB: DOB REMOVED) + HMIS# 9C0B43F66). I recently submitted a score revision for him, so he now has a 14 on his NST. His last program exit was on 10/14/21, so he should have chronicity in October of this year.
 

 If possible, I would love to recommend him for a site with a general homeless requirement, as he is hesitant to connect with a MH provider at this time. But also open to your thoughts and suggestions on the matter!
 

 Thank you!

"HCM JM reached out to YP's HH CM John. John shared that he had not been working that weekend but was told by other staff that YP did not return to his housing and therefore was at imminent risk for being exited for AWOL-ing. John reported that he would be working with his case manager Danny to provide support at court should YP arrive for his court date, although John was unsure as to when that was. John shared that he would be removed from their census roster at the end of the day if he does not return. HCM JM shared that she would reiterate to YP the importance of him returning. 
 

 HCM approached YP near the front patio and he was sitting on the floor, appearing to be very impacted by SU/MH as evidenced by disorganized speech/tangential thoughts/slurred speech. YP had his shoes/socks off and his feet were off-white/yellow and very calloused. YP shared that his feet were very itchy and he need foot powder. HCM JM and SHC RF assisted with providing foot powder and socks. YP began to speak in a frustrated tone about his program and not wanting to return. HCM JM attempted to encourage him to reconnect but YP was not interested and began to state that HCM JM was not helpful. YP shared that he wanted to be left alone. HCM JM shared that he would be exited that night and that his CM would be happy to meet with him that day if he arrived before 5 PM. YP verbalized an understanding but did not commit to returning. HCM JM underscored the importance of working with these systems in order to resolve barriers to housing. However, YP was frustrated and stated he no longer wanted to speak with HCM JM that day. HCM JM reflected back his self-determination but continued to offer support in reconnection with his program. HCM JM will continue to encourage re-connection and work with YP's partner providers to resolve his legal matters."
"YP arrived at MFP and requested a check in with HCM MJ. At the time, HCM MJ observed YP presenting in a low mood, as displayed by her sunken torso/body language, minimal eye contact, and use of short responses. YP asked if YP DL could participate in the check in, and HCM MJ attempted to hold the boundary of individual services. However, YP pushed back and stated that his presence would be extremely beneficial for her MH/strength in the conversation. HCM MJ made a one-time exception, but explained that any CM items or risk assessments/concerns that come about will be managed on an individual basis; which both YP and YP DL acknowledged understanding.
 

 YP shared details about her past relationships, experiences of trauma, and substance use since leaving MFP around July of 2022. YP shared current use and concern around a number of substances, which YP DL confirmed. HCM MJ offered to: (1) help YP confirm her current insurance status and (2) help her explore rehab programs. YP initially agreed to the insurance verification, but later on denied interest in signing ROI's to collaborate with CHLA/HAWC. YP strongly denied interest in any inpatient programs based on her previous experiences in them in New Mexico. YP requested help with a prescription for suboxone, but HCM MJ explained that she cannot prescribe any medication directly. HCM MJ also provided some general information around suboxone and it's use, but offered to connect YP to Robbie from HCIA for more in depth substance use/treatment education and resource connection. YP requested that YP DL go to the same program as her, but HCM MJ explained that like housing, this may be tricky to do as they reported using different substances and would therefore, have different treatment options/processes available. HCM MJ also advised YP that any treatment program would likely do individualized responses/intakes/care and talk to YP and YP DL separately. YP became extremely frustrated at this, denied interest in signing any ROI's for next steps, and denied interest in working with/talking to HCM MJ further. HCM MJ acknowledged understanding YP's frustration, but offered to be a support in the future if she changes her mind and wants to explore treatment options or SA resource connection.
 

 *Other: During this conversation, YP also reported concerns that MFP is becoming known as a site to sell and use drugs for youth in the Hollywood community. HCM MJ inquired further, but YP was not comfortable sharing more details or names/identities of people who are known to sell drugs onsite. HCM MJ reminded YP of the harm reduction approach/low barrier approach MFP takes, however, she thanked YP for sharing as staff will continue to be on the lookout for concerning behaviors/interactions/substance use onsite."
"HCM MJ received a phone call from YP. YP informed HCM MJ that she is still living in New Mexico, but with a new partner; as her previous relationship with YP DL had ended a few months ago. YP also informed HCM MJ that she had been working at a traveling circus/fair for a few months, but had recently been fired and moved in with her new partner (and his mother). YP shared plans of potentially moving to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and of potentially visiting LA. HCM MJ congratulated her and stated that we (staff at MFP) would love to see her sometime, but also reminded her to have proper planning and funds in place to return to New Mexico; as she had gotten stuck in LA before. YP acknowledged understanding this and agreed to engage in further planning.
 

 YP also requested a mail check/her mail to be forwarded to her new mailing address: 
 PO Box 210
 Continental Divide
 New Mexico 87312
 

 Lastly, YP asked for help applying for her benefits in the state of New Mexico, as she tried to apply for GR there but was told she would have to cancel her benefits in California. HCM MJ confirmed that this is true, and encouraged YP to cancel her CA benefits as soon as possible, as it is fraudulant to collect benefits in a state where you no longer live. HCM MJ walked YP through the steps of: creating a new DPSS account, linking it to the old account, and calling the hotline (or her specific worker) to cancel her benefits. In addition, HCM MJ explained that YP can ask that a termination of benefits letter be sent to her mailing address, so she can provide verification to the DPSS office in New Mexico. YP acknowledged understanding this, but stated she may need help with this process along the way. HCM MJ offered to be a support, but also encouraged her to connect to a drop in center nearby, as it may be more practical to have a local provider on her team as well. HCM MJ followed up with an email containing resources in a new thread entitled, 'Drop in Centers in New Mexico,' see below...

 Hi Alyssa,
 

 It was so nice hearing from you today! I did some research and found the following resources for drop in centers for homeless youth in New Mexico. A lot of them are closer to Albuquerque, but I'm hoping at least one of them will work!

 I didn't pick any in Santa Fe because it appears to be even more east of Gallup. 
 

 But I'm hoping at least one of them may be able to help with ongoing documentation, benefit or employment needs!
 

 All the best,

 Hello ????
 

 I am writing to inquire about re-admission for this young person, William (LN MANUALLY REMOVED 6/11/25) (DOB: DOB REMOVED), age 20, HMIS # 8D5F0B448) to your EESP program.
 

 Since we last spoke on Thursday, Sept 22nd, my colleague Michael Collins and I have continued to check in with William, address the behavior identified in the initial bulletin on HMIS--which has since been removed--discuss past successes and shortcomings in housing, and explore what would be different in new housing opportunities moving forward (in terms of his engagement and behavior). We believe that the behavior identified in the initial bulletin was a manifestation of trauma, and have seen William's willingness to discuss and address it. William continues to express a desire to lean into his mental health care and speak with a therapist if provided. 
 

 William has also stated that his time in your EESP program was productive. I reviewed the notes entered by DMH staff at TWI (Roberto Arias and Takeo Tucker) and have not found any concerning behaviors to be indicated. In fact, he seemed to be pretty engaged, and had a successful exit due to a THP match! Lastly, I noticed that he was still accepted into the EESP program at TWI after his stay at Jovenes, which is where the incident occured.
 

 Because of this, and his positive engagement at your EESP site, I am wondering if he can be reconsidered for entry.
 

 Thank you!
 

 Sincerely,
 

 Marisa and Mike"
"HCM JM approached YP in the patio who presented in a low mood, with good hygiene, and engaged in reciprocal conversation. YP immediately started to apologize that they missed the intake the day before without prompting from HCM JM. HCM JM asked exploratory questions about the missed appointment. YP shared that she was feeling heightened ambivalence anytime she was going to a shelter since she had a hx of hospitalizations that had a lot of rules. YP alluded to potential conflicts in shelters and how she would handle them. YP stated that she was much more in control of her emotions and behaviors than she was when she was a child/teen, but was still concerned about sharing space with others. YP reported that after some thought, she was feeling more confident about going to the shelter. YP suddenly turned to face YP LU and exclaimed her frustration with CM's focusing their attention on people with aggravated mental health and not those like herself who are more ""functioning."" YP shared that she felt like others got preferential treatment and highly disliked it when those same YPs did not take advantage of or waste resources that are provided to them. YP's mood shifted and she was frustrated/speaking in a rapid speech. HCM JM focused on YP's needs an dhow she could support them. YP shared needing an ace bandage and never having received one despite asking multiple times. HCM JM assisted with providing a bandage and they agreed to check in about rescheduling the YWCA intake appointment. 
 

 HCM JM called ABH YWCA PM Shelia Washington to advocate to reschedule the intake appointment. SW confirmed that she could reschedule an asked for an email to be sent confirming their conversation.

 ""Good afternoon Jesenya,
 Autumns HACLA application was submitted to HACLA the same day. Once we have additional information from HACLA, if any, we will follow up with you and Autumn. You and Autumn will also receive outreach from property management regarding setting up an intake with their team. We have already created a packet of supportive documents provided to provide to property management as long as they are not expired at the time of the scheduling. However, we will follow up when that time comes to provide support. Thank you.""

 HCM JM reached out by phone to Tribal Health in Lakeport, CA. HCM JM shared her role, that she had signed/active ROIs (see under ""Documents"" tab), and was seeking to obtain medical records of their mutual client. HCM JM was transferred to their medical records team but was only able to leave a VM requesting a callback. HCM JM will follow up with TH to learn more about obtaining records."
