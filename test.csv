0,24404,06/16/2023,Life Skills,YP approached TCM MC and informed him of an issue with her ABH YWCA roommate (YP JEN D.). YP reported that TS became angry in their room and threw a ceramic figurine at the floor in YP's vicinity - the figurine smashed and broke apart with pieces cutting/sticking into YP's foot. YP also reported that TS was using threatening and disparaging language towards YP while she thought YP was asleep. YP was angry and used threatening language toward TS claiming she would physically harm TS. MC reminded YP that threatening language was not allowed at MFP and if threats were not retracted she would have to leave for the day and TS would have to be informed of any physical threats. YP retracted her threats and was adamant her words were just empty threats and she uses language like that to express herself and relieve stress. TCM MC will continue to monitor the situation and how the two interact while at MFP. MC
1,24468,05/23/2024,Housing,"HCM SD spoke to Raiza from the LGBT Center about re-enrolling YP in Housing Navigation. Raiza emailed and said: ""Hello All,I am reaching out to follow up on the youth that was brought up at this morning's CCM. Sami, from My Friend's Place, is working with one of my former clients (JOSH ROWE, HMIS AA6364C7B) who shared that they wanted to re-enroll in Housing Navigation. They self-exited on 4/17/24. Sami shared that the client wanted to continue working with me, but will speak with the client to confirm. Sami wanted to know if they needed to submit another Housing Navigation referral, or if the client can be re-enrolled and by-pass the waitlist, given they've accessed our services so recently.Including the Housing Navigation management team, the matcher, and our SPA 4 Coordinator for guidance.Best,Raiza."" HCM SD will continue to discuss HN with YP.
 HCM SD met with YP and TEM CB to complete the school payment from the grant YP received from MFP. TEM CB was able to successfully pay for YP's remaining school balance. HCM SD and YP met together privately in MFP. YP reported that she wanted assistance with getting transportation to return home to Ohio. She reported that she wants to live with her mom Amy Pratt 440-822-4123 and said she was living with her mom before coming to LA. She reported that her mom wants her back and that she feels safer there. HCM SD and YP started the paperwork to apply for problem solving funds through the LGBT center. HCM SD will continue to work with YP on her goals and on the problem solving funds process."
2,24468,01/30/2024,Health & Social/Emotional Well-Being,"HCM SD received an email from William Ortega, FSP Navigator stating: ""Good morning, We have recd the FSP referral for JACKSON, JONE SRTS #125474. I confirmed with Hollywood Mental Health and your client is obtaining Outpatient Clinical Services (OCS) from them. Her current case manager indicated that MS. JACKSON canceled her appt last week, but is attempting to reschedule and offer a 03/14/2024 medication appt. HMH also indicated that MS. JACKSON is currently securing medication from Exodus on her own. As OCS is a lower level of care than FSP, her referral will be dispo'ed. In addition if this is a housing situation, I encourage you to reach out to our Service Area 4 Housing Navigator, Carol Phillips at, CPhillips@dmh.lacounty.gov"" HCM SD spoke to William on the phone to discuss. William explained FSP has recently been revamped. He said FSP is broken down into 0-20 (child) and 20+ (adult). He explained the new eligibility requirements for those 20+ are as follows: Individuals must have a qualifying serious mental illness AND have 2 psychiatric admissions in the last 12 months in CA. HCM SD was unaware of these new eligibility requirements. William also explained that if folks are linked with DMH providers like HMHC, their team may internally refer them to FSP if they believe that level of care is appropriate (and In that case, folks do not necessarily need to meet all eligibility requirements when internally referred). William reported that YP does not meet eligibility requirements as she has not had 2 psychiatric admissions in CA in the last 12 months. HCM SD called and left a VM for Daniela, SW at HMHC. Daniele replied via email and she said: ""I received your message I am definitely on the same page as you in that I do believe MS. JACKSON would benefit from the services, but unfortunately the decision is not up to me. I reached out for an update this morning. I emailed the FSP navigator William Ortega, and he is saying that she doesn't meet criteria because she hasn't been hospitalized at least twice in the past year. I'm going to reach out to MS. JACKSON by email to try to set up an appointment for her to come into the office. If she continues to miss appointments, I might be able to refer her to our field outreach team, they are able to go out to see her as long as she's living in the Hollywood area."" HCM SD will continue to coordinate with Daniela, FSP and YP."

 Good morning Albert,
 

 I just reached out by phone to follow up about JAY SUE'S referral. He is currently staying in an emergency shelter but his time is limited there. Any chance you are able to share if his referral is close to being at the top of the waitlist? I plan on advocating for him to stay longer at his shelter if you're able to provide a timeline. Please feel free to call me back at 213-589-8572.
 

 Thank you so much!
 Jesenya""
 

 HCM JM reached out to DMH Marisol F to share that she would update her once she knew more information. 
 

 HCM JM checked in with YP in the drop in center who presented in a positive mood, good hygiene, and engaged in reciprocal conversation. YP shared that he was working with his CM but was still interested in LARB. HCM JM obtained ROIs for DMH/LARB (under ""documents"") and confirmed that she would keep YP updated once she learns more. YP shared that his semester starts in late August and was hoping to find a placement by then. HCM JM will continue to work with YP on securing a LARB placement."
4,14772,05/05/2023,Gate Visit,"YP arrived at the front gate after drop in hours to pick up mail. He brought a friend with him who was also picking up mail. YP shared that he gave our address to use as a safe place for her social security card to be delivered to. She showed ID for verification since she is unknown to MFP. Her name is JANE DOE DOB 10/10/2000. LSHC JG shared that MFP will keep an eye out for it, however asked that she refrain from using this address as her mailing address since she is not know to MFP and out of MFP's service age range.

 Hi all!
 

 I hope everyone is doing well and enjoying the sunnier weather these days. I wanted to reach out to those of us working with/connected to JOHN DOE (DOB: 2/10/1993). As we (at MFP) are figuring out our capacity in our pilot program to work with folks ages 25-30, we're finding ourselves in a position to plan/connect/refer young people who are rapidly approaching age 30 or, as in JOHNNIE's case, are already 30. I'm hoping to get this team of folks together to discuss ongoing housing efforts/opportunities/plans/goals and next steps for JOHN. Please let me know what your availability is in the coming weeks and we can go from there. Thank you all for your continued efforts and care for JD!
 

 Best,
 Megan
 

 HCM MF spoke with CES Specialist at The Center Josh Hoffman (JH) on the phone. HCM MF explained the goal of re-engaging with The Center for adult services and YP's hesitancy around engaging in a new space and having to establish new case management relationships. JH empathized and offered to brainstorm incentives with HCM MF that would make YP's visits to The Center more worthwhile and exciting. HCM MF also asked if she could visit The Center with YP during their weekly meetings and JH confirmed. HCM MF asked about YP's eligibility to TLS in the adult system and JH confirmed that TLS could be a good option for YP pending he understands that a) it will wipe his homelessness chronicity and b) he knows that after two years, he will be responsible for the entirety of his rent payment. JH explained that technically ABH Schrader would need to refer YP to Housing Navigation (through Volunteers of America) and they would work with YP to connect him to TLS units. Alternatively, JH said that if YP had a unit in mind, they could potentially advocate for YP to be connected to The People Concern for TLS. JH advised discussing the options with YP to gauge his interest and HCM MF will do so. JH also offered to connect with Adult Matcher Berenice Hernandez-Rodriguez to advocate for any housing opportunities for YP. HCM MF will email JH information about YP's chronicity and housing history.
 

 Schrader PM Gary Caldera (GC) responded to HCM MF's email stating that YP had not been onsite for a few days and that an exit was being considered for excessive absences. HCM MF asked how long his bed could be held and PM GC stated ""72 hours"" and that they would be checking hospitals and jails. If YP happens to be in the hospital or incarcerated then the bed can be held for 7 days. HCM MF thanked PM GC for the information and will update him with any contact with YP. HCM MF called YP but it went straight to voicemail. HCM MF emailed YP alerting him to the possible exit and checking in to make sure he is okay. 
 

 Update: YP's Schrader CM emailed HCM MF confirming that YP has been onsite and was seen by CM recently. CM explained that there was a system error showing that YP had not been onsite but that the error has since been corrected and YP is not at risk of losing his bed. -MF"
